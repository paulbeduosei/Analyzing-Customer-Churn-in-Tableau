# Analyzing-Customer-Churn-in-Tableau
Just wrapped up a deep-dive into customer churn at Databel using Tableau! 🚀 From why people leave to who’s most at risk, this interactive dashboard uncovers the story behind the numbers—and points us straight to the action items.

Some Key Insights

Competitor Wins: “Better offers elsewhere” is by far the #1 churn driver (≈16% of all customers).

Contract Stickiness: Month-to-month subscribers churn at nearly double the rate of 1- and 2-year contracts.

Age Dynamics: Churn climbs sharply after age 65—opportunity for targeted retention.

Plan Impact: Unlimited data holders churn ~10% less than those on base plans, suggesting value perception is everything.

Geographic Hotspots: Certain states (CA) show elevated churn clusters—perfect targets for localized promos.
